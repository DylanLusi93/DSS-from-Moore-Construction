# DSS-from-Moore-Construction
Constructs an optimally block-labelled Moore Design, or equivalently a point labelling of the dual of the Moore Design, with DiffSum either 0 or 3.

For details on the theory, see the included paper "Block Labellings of Resolvable 1-Rotational Steiner 2-Designs", of which this project is an implementation.
